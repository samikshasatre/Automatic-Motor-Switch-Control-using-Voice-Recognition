# Automatic-Motor-Switch-Control-using-Voice-Recognition
Automatic Motor Switch Control using Voice Recognition uses an ESP8266 NodeMCU, L298N motor driver, and Sinric Pro to control a DC motor via Alexa/Google Assistant. Users can turn the motor ON/OFF or change direction with voice commands, enabling smart, hands-free, and remote motor operation for home or industrial use.
